# Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System 

This Python project is a Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System using OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The application allows users to upload an image containing a vehicle number plate, and it extracts the plate number using image processing techniques. The extracted plate number is then used to identify the state to which the vehicle belongs. The project also includes a graphical user interface developed with Tkinter, providing a user-friendly experience. The system displays the original image, detected license plate, and predicted license plate number along with the corresponding state. Additionally, the application allows users to save the results, including the image with the detected license plate and associated information, to a MySQL database. This project demonstrates skills in image processing, OCR, database integration, and GUI development.
